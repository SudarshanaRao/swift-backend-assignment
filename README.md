# Node.js Backend Assignment - SWIFT Company

This is a backend project built using **Node.js**, **TypeScript**, and **MongoDB**. It was developed as part of an internship assignment for SWIFT Company. The application provides a set of RESTful APIs to manage users, their posts, and comments, all sourced from [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/).

---

## üöÄ Features

- Node.js server built with TypeScript
- MongoDB integration using official `mongodb` driver
- Collections: `users`, `posts`, `comments`
- RESTful API endpoints
- Typed request and response bodies
- Fetches and stores dummy data from JSONPlaceholder

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Node.js
- TypeScript
- MongoDB
- ts-node (for running TypeScript directly)

---

## üìÅ Project Setup (Local Development)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/node_assignment.git
cd node_assignment
```

---

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

---

### 3. Add TypeScript Configuration

If not already present, create a tsconfig.json file:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES6",
    "module": "CommonJS",
    "rootDir": "src",
    "outDir": "dist",
    "strict": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true
  }
}
```
---

### 4. Ensure MongoDB is Running
- Make sure your MongoDB server is running locally on the default port (27017).

---

### 5. Run the Application

```bash
npx ts-node src/server.ts
```

- You can also install ts-node globally if needed:

```bash
npm install -g ts-node
```

---
